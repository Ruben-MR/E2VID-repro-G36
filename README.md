# This is the README of the blog for the reproducibility project

## Here we can note down things, links or whichever information we may deem relevant as well as modified files to save each other some time and avoid re-implementing the same thing three times

I have found this [repository](https://github.com/gorchard/event-Python) from Garrick Orchard in which he claims to have a *VERY* initial version of some files for handling event data. However, I think that the authors themselves have included some files for parsing and reading the data from these datasets, but we wil need to try it out.

Btw, I the link to n-MNIST is [here](https://www.garrickorchard.com/datasets/n-mnist).
